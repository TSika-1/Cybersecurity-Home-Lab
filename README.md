# Cybersecurity Home Lab – Microsoft Sentinel SOC

##  Overview
This project is a self-directed cybersecurity home lab designed to simulate a SOC environment using Microsoft Sentinel. It demonstrates threat detection, monitoring, and response workflows.

##  Goals
- Deploy Microsoft Sentinel and ingest logs
- Create custom detection rules using KQL
- Simulate attacks and analyze alerts
- Build core SOC skills: detection, investigation, response

##  Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft Sentinel
- Azure Log Analytics
- Windows Server (Active Directory)
- Windows 10/11 Endpoints
- Sysmon
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)

##  Implementation
1. Built an isolated virtual network environment  
2. Deployed Windows Server 2022 as a domain controller  
3. Joined endpoints and forwarded Windows logs to Sentinel  
4. Created custom analytics rules and watchlists  
5. Tested detection using simulated attack activity  

##  Key Capabilities
- SIEM log ingestion and correlation  
- Custom threat detection using KQL  
- Alert investigation and response playbooks  

##  Skills Demonstrated
- SIEM configuration and tuning  
- Log analysis and incident detection  
- Threat simulation and response planning  
- Documentation and SOC workflow execution
